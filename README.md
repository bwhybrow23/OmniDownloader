# OmniDownloader
**Omni** - all
**Downloader** - a program that downloads content from the internet

Originally created as CoomerManager, this application was intended to be a manager solely for the [Coomer](https://coomer.su) website. However, I've decided to expand its functionality to be able to download content from more than just the Coomer platform.

In a nutshell, it's a content downloader that you can also periodically run and, using a duplicate checker, will download any new content from the creators you've added to the watchlist.

**OmniDownloader is compatible with any platform that supports NodeJS.** It has been tested on Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04.
